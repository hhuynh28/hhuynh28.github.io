        <center><h3>Context of the Game</h3></center>
        <center><p>The game is pretty simple to play. Help Bandana Dee dodge the falling
        stars. A point will be rewarded when the player successfully dodges the 
        stars. The game will end or the player will lose when Bandana Dee touches 
        a star or any other obstacle in any way. The player must click on the 
        green flag to restart or to replay the game. The game becomes increasingly
        difficult when the player surpasses 30 points, where the addition of 
        tomatoes will fall alongside with the stars. When the player surpasses 
        60 points, the game becomes more difficult, since two more obstacles, 
        mushrooms and hearts, will fall alongside the stars and the tomatoes. There 
        is a random number generator next to the score to indicate the random 
        number of obstacles falling. There is some randomness in the game in that 
        the stars will randomly fall in different positions.</p></center>

        <center><h3>Game Reflection</h3></center>
        <center><p>I don't play a lot of games but when I do play games, they are
        usually the dodging games, where the player has to dodge obstacles that 
        are thrown their way. Because of that, I was inspired by some of my favorite
        simple games, thus my recreation of the dodging games that I play. Two 
        successful points in the development of the process of my game were the
        scores in that it was able to add points whenever the player dodged an 
        obstacle as well as the game's ability to allow the sprite to move to avoid 
        the obstacles by using the right and left arrow keys. Two obstacles that I
        faced while creating the game were restarting the game as well as having the new 
        sprites to fall. I originally wanted the game to restart immediately after 
        the game ended, but I had to compromise and allow the game to restart when 
        the green flag was pressed. As for the new sprites, I had to set the code 
        so that the new sprites would fall when the player reached either 30 or 60 points.
        If I had more time, I would like to fulfill my original wish to have the game
        restart immediately after the game ended as well as to fix the various bugs that 
        the game occassionally had when a player first started the game. An algorithm 
        that contributed significantly to the game would be the 'if-then' block. 
        I believe that it is an algorithm since it was able to solve different classes 
        of problems and was able to connect the game together well altogether. The way
        the 'if-then' block works is basically when a certain criteria is needed to be 
        met, the block will allow it to work if the scenario occurs, and when it does 
        occur, then something or another scenario will take place. </p></center>
